        <figcaption>Demo of the turntable tool within Modeling</figcaption>
        <p>
          I automated the creation of a turntable for an asset for both modeling and surfacing. This tool
          first reads an XML file that has pre-set settings for the turntable. In this, for each discipline,
          there are two different quality options, either low or high quality. The tool will show either
          the modeling settings or the surfacing settings depending on the discipline in which the asset was 
          opened. At any point, the XML file can be changed to have new settings and these will automatically 
          apply to the turntable. Here's an example of part of the XML settings file: <br></br>
          <img
          src="/assets/images/turntable/xml-settings.png"
          alt="xml-settings"
          loading="lazy"
          class="single-proj-img"
          />
        </p>
        <h2>Tool Steps</h2>
        <p>
            After opening the asset the artist wants to create a turntable for, they can open the turntable tool from
            within our pipeline and choose the quality they would like. Within modeling, low quality means
            playblasting the proxy, whereas high is the render. Here's an example of what it looks like in modeling:
        </p>
        <div class="multi-img-wrapper">
            <img
            src="/assets/images/turntable/model-low.png"
            alt="model-low"
            loading="lazy"
            class="proj-img"
            />
            <img
            src="/assets/images/turntable/model-high.png"
            alt="model-high"
            loading="lazy"
            class="proj-img"
            />
        </div>
        <p>
            The artist can then click create, which will playblast the turntable and save the turntable video 
            both locally and on our network (where all of our project files are stored) in that asset's 
            directory of official files. Note that, in modeling, two playblasts are made: one with wireframe
            and one without. These are then merged together into one video to create the final turntable.
            <br></br>
            Within surfacing, there are still two different quality options for the turntable but the 
            settings are for rendering each frame of the turntable. Again, the artist clicks create, which 
            will render the surfacing frames, combine all the frames together to create the video, then save 
            the turntable video both locally and on our network in that asset's directory of official files.
            Here's an example of what it looks like in surfacing:
        </p> 
        <div class="multi-img-wrapper">
            <img
            src="/assets/images/turntable/surfacing-low.png"
            alt="surfacing-low"
            loading="lazy"
            class="proj-img"
            />
            <img
            src="/assets/images/turntable/surfacing-high.png"
            alt="surfacing-high"
            loading="lazy"
            class="proj-img"
            />
        </div>
