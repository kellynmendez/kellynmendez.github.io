        <h1>Overview Of My Work In Animation Lab</h1>
        <p>
          Animation Lab has produced many animated shorts over the last decade, with production tending to last for about
          a year and a half from the start of pre-production to the premiere.

          I joined Bad Timing for the second half of its production, so the main focus was surfacing, 
          rigging, animation, and lighting. Jumping straight into pipeline management with only a little previous
          tools development experience was very challenging, and I spent a majority of my time on this short learning and experimenting 
          with our pipeline and understanding our codebase. I mostly focused on troubleshooting problems and bugs that artists ran into, 
          especially for the last few weeks, to get the final short ready for the premiere which was in December of 2022.
          <br></br>
          Beyond just troubleshooting, I also worked with the rest of the TD team on a way for surfacing artists to work locally. One of the
          artists' biggest recurring problems is our network drive, which greatly slows down access to work files. As a result, previous TDs worked 
          on ways to download files from the network to the artist's local computer so artists could have quicker access to them then version back up 
          to the network when they finish working. This workflow is much simpler for a discipline like modeling, but with surfacing it was a little 
          more involved because we needed to take into account texture file dependencies and handle the workflow accordingly.

        <p>
          Production on our animated short Red Hat Ringo began in January 2023, and the short premiered in December
          2023. My task during this short was beginning integration of Universal Scene Description (USD) in our assembly workflow,
          which required designing the USD layer structure for assets and shots and automating the essential steps. Red Hat Ringo 
          used Maya for all of its production pipeline except for lighting, which was done in Unreal 5, so the USD pipeline for this 
          short spanned across both DCCs.

        <h2>About Sunny</h2>
        <img

        <p>
          <br></br>
          Sunny's production began in January 2024, and the short will be finished and premiered in December 2024. 
          Since the project has started, I have been continuing to update and add to the USD assembly pipeline, which is now being
          used in lighting. Things I have added include importing the right assembly into shots across disciplines, as well
          as texturing the assembly in lighting. I have also done a lot of maintenance and troubleshooting on our pipeline, 
          which has mostly consisted of updating animation, layout, and surfacing publish code, as well as smoothing out USD errors
          as they pop up. Since the short wrapped in December of 2024, it has been submitted into multiple festivals so I do not 
          have permission to post it here yet.
