        <h1>Cozy Book Stacks</h1>

            I made this environment over the course of two weeks. I loved making this environment because I had
            been wanting to create something with books since I love to read, and I wanted to have a realistic scene 
            filled with all my favorite books composed in a homey, comforting way. All of the assets were
            rendered in Maya, textured in Substance Painter and Procreate, and rendered in Unreal 5.
            <br></br>
            The first week of the project I created a design document for my concept and art style, made an 
            asset list of everything I wanted to put in the scene in order of high to low priority, then 
            created a whitebox. The second week was spent refining my models, texturing, and lighting 
            and post-processing. All of the closed books are made with the same model, each textured to be a 
            different book (except for <i>I'll Give You The Sun</i>, which has an extra plane on top of the
            normal book model since that's how the cover of the real book is designed).
            <br></br>
            I really enjoyed doing this project because creating a cozy environment that evokes comfort of reading was 
            very personally satisfying. My favorite asset to make in this project was the open
            book because all of the annotations in the book are my real annotations of Pride and 
            Prejudice, which I just rewrote into the color map and added sticky notes with related annotations. 
            I really enjoyed making the book look visually pleasing, and I had a lot of fun putting in those details.
