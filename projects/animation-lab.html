        <h1>UTD Animation Lab</h1>
        <p>
          Animation lab is a course UTD offers in which a group of around fifty students make an animated short over the
          course of two semesters. The course is designed to simulate an animation studio, including a pipeline that
          was created a few years ago which manages file access and sharing throughout every stage of the pipeline.
          The project I am currently working on is called Sunny, a short about a circle moving to a city of squares.
          Since I joined in August of 2022, I've worked on two other projects: Red Hat Ringo, a western-themed animated short which
          premiered in December of 2023, and Bad Timing, a monster-themed animated short which premiered in 
          December of 2022.

        <h2>USD Assembly Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          My main task since January 2023 has been to create an assembly workflow that uses Universal Scene 
          Description (USD), a recently released software platform developed by Pixar that manages 3D animation 
          data efficiently, to handle managing layouts and set dressing. I was tasked with designing a way for
          layout artists to assemble a set using USD rather than the old assembly workflow, and I did this by 
          automating essential parts of the USD pipeline and creating a tool artists could use to easily 
          manage the USD data in their layout. I have been working on this throughout production of Red 
          Hat Ringo and production of Sunny.

            versions of the model to USD and stores them on the network.</li>

            it on the network.</li>   
          <li style="padding-left:10px">When a set dressing artist first opens an assembly asset, a base USD file named after the asset is 
            created and imported into their Maya scene. When the base USD is created:</li>

            <li style="margin-left: 50px; padding-left:10px">The USD kind is set to assembly. This is done so that an assembly can be imported

            added to the set sublayer of the general shot layer. Then, a layout layer is 
            created and targeted for any extra changes layout may need to make to the assembly.

            Lighting imports the general shot layer into their scene. Similarly, a Lighting sublayer
            is created and targeted. The assembly's stage display purpose is set to render to show

        <p>
          I joined Bad Timing for the second semester of its production, so the main focus for the semester was surfacing, 
          rigging, animation, and lighting. Jumping straight into pipeline management with only a semester of previous
          tools development experience was very challenging; my teammate and I were given the code for the main modules, and 
          we spent a majority of our time for the first semester learning and experimenting with the pipeline.
          We mostly focused on troubleshooting problems and bugs that artists ran into, especially for the last few weeks to get the final
          short ready for the premiere, which was in December of 2022.
          <br></br>
          Beyond just troubleshooting, my teammate and I also worked on a way for surfacing artists to work locally. One of the
          artists' biggest recurring problems is our network drive due to how slow it is to access files work on 
          pipe. As a result, previous technical directors worked on ways to download files from the network so artists
          could work on them locally then have them version back up to the network when they finish working. This workflow is much
          simpler for a discipline like modeling, but with surfacing it was a little more involved because we needed to take into
          account file dependencies and handle the workflow accordingly.

          Production on our animated short Red Hat Ringo began in January 2023, and the short premiered in December
          2023. Since the project has started, I have had a hand in automating the USD pipeline which we have used for layout starting in
          the pre-production stage. As the project continues, I will expand the basic pipeline I have automated so far, aid in surfacing the
          USD in Unreal 5, and continue to trouble-shoot general pipeline problems that the artists run into as the short begins to wrap up.
          Since the short wrapped in December of 2023, it has been submitted and accepted into multiple festivals so I do not have 
          permission to post it here yet.

        <p>
          Sunny's production began in January 2024, and the short will be finished and premiered in December 2024. 
          Since the project has started, I have been continuing to update and add to the USD assembly pipeline, which is now being
          used in lighting. Things I have added include importing the right assembly into shots across disciplines, as well
          as texturing the assembly in lighting. I have also done a lot of maintenance and troubleshooting on our pipeline, 
          which has mostly consisted of updating animation, layout, and surfacing publish code, as well as smoothing out USD errors
          as they pop up.
