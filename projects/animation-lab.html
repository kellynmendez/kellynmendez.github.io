        <h1>UTD Animation Lab</h1>
        <p>
          Animation lab is a course UTD offers in which a group of around fifty students make an animated short over the
          course of two semesters. The course is designed to simulate an animation studio, including a pipeline that
          was created a few years ago which manages file access and sharing throughout every stage of the pipeline.
          The project I am currently working on is called Red Hat Ringo, a western-themed animated short, and since I joined
          in August of 2022, I've worked on one other project, Bad Timing, a monster-themed animated short which premiered in 
          December of 2022.

        <h2>USD Layout Pre-Production Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          Work on our animated short Red Hat Ringo began in January of 2023, and my main task since the project started has been creating
          a workflow for layout that uses Universal Scene Description (USD), a recently released software platform developed by Pixar
          that manages 3D animation data efficiently, to handle managing layouts and set dressing. I was tasked with designing a way for
          layout artists to assemble a set using USD rather than the old assembly workflow, and I did this by automating essential parts
          of the USD pipeline and creating a tool artists could use to easily manage the USD data in their layout.
        </p>
        <h3>Overview of Pipeline Steps</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li style="padding-left:10px">The modeling team publishes their work which creates the supporting assembly files. Creating the 
            supporting assembly files exports the proxy (and render, if it exists) versions of the model to USD and stores them on the network.</li> 
          <li style="padding-left:10px">When a layout artist first opens an assembly asset, a base USD file named after the asset is 
            created and to be imported into their Maya scene. When the base USD is created:</li> 
          <ol type="a">
            <li style="margin-left: 50px; padding-left:10px">The USD kind is set to assembly. This is done so that the layout can be imported 
              into another layout in the future if needed.</li> 
            <li style="margin-left: 50px; padding-left:10px">A prim named ‘contents’ is created and set to be the default prim for the USD. 
              All assets in the future are automatically imported into the contents prim.</li>
          </ol>
          <img
          src="/assets/images/usd-code/create-usd-code.png"
          alt="create-usd-code"
          loading="lazy"
          class="code-img"
          />
          <li style="padding-left:10px">The layout artist uses the USD Manager tool to add and remove assets to the USD, then they can 
            move them around as needed.</li>
          <br></br>
          <img
          src="/assets/images/usd-manager.png"
          alt="usd-manager-gui"
          loading="lazy"
          class="single-proj-img"
          />
          <br></br>
          <ol type="a">
            <li style="margin-left:50px; padding-left:10px">The tool queries ShotGrid to gather project data and assemble a list of all a
              ssets in the project, with icons that indicate whether layout is able to pull in the asset.</li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li style="margin-left:100px; padding-left:10px">Green icons indicate that the asset's USD file exists on the network so 
                the artist can therefore import the asset into their layout.</li> 
              <li style="margin-left:100px; padding-left:10px">Red icons indicate that the asset cannot be imported.</li> 
              <li style="margin-left:100px; padding-left:10px">Yellow icons indicate an assembly asset.</li> 
            </ol>
            <li style="margin-left:50px; padding-left:10px">The artist can check the assets they want to import into the layout (Import 
              Checked Assets).</li>
            <ol type="i">
              <li style="margin-left:100px; padding-left:10px">When they import an asset, it creates a prim with a USD reference.</li> 
            </ol>
            <img
            src="/assets/images/usd-code/import-asset-code.png"
            alt="import-asset-code"
            loading="lazy"
            class="code-img"
            />
            <li style="margin-left:50px; padding-left:10px">The artist can check the assets they want to remove from the layout 
              (Remove Checked Assets).</li>
            <img
            src="/assets/images/usd-code/remove-asset-code.png"
            alt="remove-asset-code"
            loading="lazy"
            class="code-img"
            />
            <li style="margin-left:50px; padding-left:10px">The artist can choose to reload the USD if they would like to reload any 
              changes made to any USD references while they were working with it (Reload All Assets).</li>
          </ol>
          <li style="padding-left:10px">From here, the USD can be pulled into Animation’s shots in Maya as well as into Lighting’s 
            shots in Unreal (our pipeline has departments working between Unreal and Maya). This same tool shown above also exists in the Unreal workflow since artists are able to open and edit assets in both Maya and Unreal in our pipeline.</li> 
        </ol>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Layers</h3>
        <img
        src="/assets/images/usd-layer-editor.png"
        alt="usd-layer-editor"
        loading="lazy"
        class="single-proj-img"
        />
        <p>
          The above image shows the USD layer editor and how sublayers can be used in the USD workflow. In the outliner, you can see the prims that were imported into the base USD, as well as the base prim 'contents' that holds the entire layout.
          Whenever an artist imports an asset into the USD, it automatically makes those changes in the base layer, which contains the initial layout. If an artist makes any changes to the layout that is not included in the initial layout, they choose a different layer based on their department.

        <p>
          I joined Bad Timing for the second semester of its production, so the main focus for the semester was surfacing, 
          rigging, animation, and lighting. Jumping straight into pipeline management with only a semester of previous
          tools development experience was very challenging; my teammate and I were given the code for the main modules, and 
          we spent a majority of our time for the first semester learning and experimenting with the pipeline.
          We mostly focused on troubleshooting problems and bugs that artists ran into, especially for the last few weeks to get the final
          short ready for the premiere.
          <br></br>
          Beyond just troubleshooting, my teammate and I also worked on a way for surfacing artists to work locally. One of the
          artists' biggest recurring problems is our network drive due to how slow it is to access files work on 
          pipe. As a result, previous technical directors worked on ways to download files from the network so artists
          could work on them locally then have them version back up to the network when they finish working. This workflow is much
          simpler for a discipline like modeling, but with surfacing it was a little more involved because we needed to take into
          account file dependencies and handle the workflow accordingly.

          Production on our animated short Red Hat Ringo began in January 2023, and the short will be finished and premiered in December
          2023. Since the project has started, I have had a hand in automating the USD pipeline which we have used for layout starting in
          the pre-production stage. As the project continues, I will expand the basic pipeline I have automated so far, aid in surfacing the
          USD in Unreal 5, and continue to trouble-shoot general pipeline problems that the artists run into as the short begins to wrap up.
