          This game was made for the Student Game Developer Association's 40-hour game jam in Spring 2022,
          where the theme was "One's Trash is Another's Treasure." Our game won the award for "Best Audio."
          In <i>Fleabag</i>, you play as a racoon that has to collect as much trash as possible before being
          killed by the hordes of rats. You also have the option to light a trash can instead of loot it, and
          lighting a trash can will keep rats away from you until the trash can burns out.
          <br><br>
          For this game, I had a hand in programming everything except for the enemy AI of the rats, but I would say my
          two biggest contributions were programming the UI as well as player behavior.
          <br><br>
          As an overview in regards to player behavior, the racoon had to be able to move into position in front of a trash can then dig through it
          whenever a button was held down. To do this, I had to account for how to choose the trach can when the racoon
          is within the collider of multiple trash cans at once, and I had to lock all controls while the racoon is digging.
          To accomplish this, the player controller script uses states to know when the racoon is digging or not, and it keeps
          a list of trash bins that the racoon is within range of, so when the button for digging is held, it calculates the
          closest trash can and uses coroutines to move the racoon in front of the trash can and start the digging time. The
          trash cans themselves also have a state machine set up to move them between ready, looting/lit, and recharging states.
