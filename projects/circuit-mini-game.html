        <p>
          This game was made as a final project for my Scripting for Games I class. The assignment was to pick a mechanic from any game
          and remake it as accurately as possible. I was interested in programming the mechanics of a puzzle game, which ultimately 
          led to me choosing the circuit board mini game from the game Spider-Man.
          <br><br>
          As the basis of the game mechanics, I set up a state machine that allows switches between the inventory and the circuit board, 
          and only allows using the different mechanics of the inventory and board when in the right state. 
          The inventory itself is also a state machine, and it switches between the normal inventory and the inventory that 
          contains voltage circuits whenever a voltage spot is selected on the board.
          <br><br>
          The most significant piece of logic in the game is tracking which circuits were connected to the starting circuit
          to create the connection line and also determine when the player wins. This was done by maintaining a linked list
          of connected circuits that is updated every time a circuit is added, removed, or rotated. Any circuit that is in the list
          will always have its connection line activated and any that are not in the list are always deactivated. Finally, when
          the list of circuits connects from start to end, the player has won and the game is over.
          <br><br>
          For the art, I drew the background and all of the circuits in Procreate. My goal when I was making this game was 
          to make everything as close to the original as possible; in general, this project required many more added UI details 
          than any others I've done before, so a lot of my time was spent on drawing the art and adding those details.
          For reference, the following is a clip from PlayStation's walkthrough video of the specific puzzle that I chose to remake
          (the full walkthrough video can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MRiYFL6Kxk">here</a>):
