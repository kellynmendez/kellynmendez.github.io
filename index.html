              I am an aspiring technical artist passionate about applying programming skills in both technical and 
              creative environments, whether it be game development or animation.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a double major in Computer Science (B.S.) and Arts, Technology, and
            Emerging Communication (B.A.) with a concentration in animation and games at the 
            University of Texas at Dallas. I love working in creative environments 
            which is what led me to study the animation and games industry, and I love
            working with other artists to bring their visions to life. I am passionate about 
            scripting for both games and animation, and I am always looking to explore 
            different disciplines and apply my skills in new ways, whether through technical
            art or software engineering. I have previously worked with artists in almost all
            art disciplines of a standard animation pipeline, and I am also skilled in modeling 
            fundamentals and I do environment art as a secondary interest.
            <br><br>
            I am experienced in using Python and Pyside2/PyQt for creating tools in Maya and Unreal,
            as well as in using the Unreal and Unity to create games. I am very proficient 
            in C/C++ and Java, and I have also explored web development through the creation 
            of this portfolio, which was created using HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript. Finally, I am
            capable with Maya, Photoshop, and Substance Painter and have used all three for past projects.
