              I am a Pipeline TD and Technical Artist passionate about applying programming in both technical and 
              creative environments, whether it be game development or animation.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I love working at the intersection of art, creativity, and technology, 
            which is what led me to study tool development and pipeline work within animation and games, and I love
            working with other artists to bring their visions to life. I studied at the University of Texas at Dallas where
            I was a double degree student, receiving a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Art, Technology, and
            Emerging Communication with a Concentration in Animation and Games. I am passionate about 
            scripting for both games and animation, and I am always looking to explore 
            different disciplines and apply my skills in new ways, whether through technical
            art or software engineering. I have previously worked with artists in almost all
            art disciplines of a standard animation pipeline. Finally, I am also skilled in modeling 
            fundamentals and I do environment art (and a lil bit of rigging) as secondary interests.
            <br><br>
            I am very experienced in using Python and Pyside2/PyQt for creating tools in Maya and Unreal,
            as well as in using the Unreal and Unity game engines to create games. I am also very proficient 
            in C/C++ and Java, and I have also explored web development through the creation 
            of this portfolio, which was created using HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript. Finally, I am
            capable with Maya, Photoshop, and Substance Painter, and have used all three for past projects.
